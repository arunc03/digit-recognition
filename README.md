# Digit Recognition
A Python project creating a numerical recognition tool.


This project involves creating a neural network in order to fit numeric images to there corresponding labels. These images and labels were taken from the MNIST database, which is protected by the MIT license. The user can use the GUI to either upload a 28 by 28 pixel JPEG file or can manually draw a numeric digit and the model will predict the digit.

This project consists of:
- GUI.py (the GUI file)
- Main.py (the actual functional files)
- data.zip (this needs to be decompressed for use).

Resources used:
- MNIST database: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ (LICENSED USING MIT)
